\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Matrix factorizations are an important class of linear algebra problems. CX is a promising method for interpretable data analytics.
\item We have performed an in-depth analysis of performance of CX algorithm on a single node implementation, and a distributed node implementation utilizing Spark
\item We have performed a head-to-head study of our Spark implementation on state of the art HPC and data center platforms
\item We have applied the software to enable first-time science results on a massive 1TB sized mass spec imaging dataset
\end{itemize}
