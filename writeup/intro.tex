\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}



We start with a description of matrix factorization algorithms in Section~\ref{sxn:low-rank-methods}, followed by single node and multi-node implementation details in Section~\ref{sec:implementation}. We review the experimental setup for all of our performance tests in Section~\ref{sec:setup}, followed by results and discussion in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
