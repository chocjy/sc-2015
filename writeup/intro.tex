\item include discussion about what CX solves and why should the community care about it? <Michael Mahoney>

\item How can database community benefit from CX? <??>

\item Applicability to various domains. <Michael Mahoney>

\item word on increasing dataset sizes (nnzs -- $10^{12}$?)  <Michael, Jey, Prabhat>
 \item Why HPC problem? Why should be fast?

\item Why focusing on SPARK? and not on any other platform? <Jey>

\item Architecture trend... Increasing SIMD width, number of cores, etc. Memory bandwidth not increasing at the same rate. Imp. to devise algorithms that block for caches and thereby compute vs bandwidth bound <Jatin, Mike R.>
